                A page to share about myself and personal projects! <br><br>

                After multiple attempts to make a personal website, I think I've settled on
                something I'm happy about sharing :D.
                I designed this site so that if you are here for the content (viewing my experience and personal projects),
                you can find it linearly and quickly. However, I also wanted to make it a place where I could share my interests,
                so I've added them in hidden places. If you want to see the other content on this website, try becoming more
                acquainted with the Memory Keeper ;). <br><br>

                An original technical project for IEEE TAMU! <br><br>
                
                The competition spiel: Club members group up in teams to make either an Arduino breadboard or PCB game controller based
                on their current skill level. Workshops are held on breadboarding, Arduino, hardware implementation
                (joystick and push buttons), soldering, and PCB design. After teams finish their designs, they
                will compete by playing a competitive version of a custom-made game called Pixel Mouse for the fastest average time in
                3 maze levels for prizes. <br><br>

                The Pixel Mouse game has 11 unique hotkeys, however only 4 (WASD/cardinal movement) are necessary to
                complete the game; all other hotkeys are coding challenges which give a better edge in completing a
                level quicker. <br><br>

                The game code has a function called 'private void Update() {}', which is a function that is repeatedly ran. It is useful for
                recieving real-time feedback from the player (this is similar to 'void loop() {}' in Arduino). The game is coded so
                that when a hotkey is registered, the action of that hotkey will play. For example, if you press 'J', the expected
                behavior would be to jump. However, on a keyboard, the button behavior is to spam the character when you hold a key down.
                Therefore the game had to be coded so that it only accounts for 1 'J' when you press a button down, instead of spamming
                the jump action everytime 'J' is registered per button press. <br><br>

                There are 2 versions of Pixel Mouse--a keyboard-compatible and Arduino-compatible version.
                The keyboard-compatible version shows the correct behavior of how Pixel Mouse should be ran, and the game's code
                accounts for the spamming behavior.
                The Arduino compatible version is essentially a bugged version of the way the game is meant to be played. The same 
                mechanism of 'if a hotkey is registered, the action of that hotkey will play' applies, however the game isn't coded 
                to account for the spamming behavior. Instead, it will be coded on the Arduino game controller.
                For the same example of 'J', you would want to code the button so that if you pressed the button, regardless of how
                long you hold it down, it will only register one 'J'. All hotkeys, button behavior, workshops, and general information are on the Pixel Mouse website
                linked below! <br><br>

                Before Pixel Mouse, I was originally interested in the design of a game controller.
                At the time, I was playing the PC version of NieR:Automata and heard many comments of 
                how the gameplay was made with a controller in mind instead of KBM. I had an idea of creating
                a handheld game controller using a PCB. While I had this idea, I was
                also dabbling in game design, so I just decided to make a game that worked exclusively
                with the way I would program the Arduino game controller, Pixel Mouse!

                I am still game-controller-less (the Pixel Mouse game controller
                effectively works as a keyboard emulator), but throughout this project I was able to learn some cool skills! <br><br>

                A game where the player can write a letter on a leaf plane! <br><br>

                This game takes place in a world that has a special tree. The leaves on this tree
                grow in a way where they naturally crease at their stems. When they fall from the tree,
                the wind shapes the leaves into a plane-like form while carrying away the tree’s
                sticky seeds. Sometimes, the leaves don’t travel very far. Characters from this
                world like to etch messages on these fallen leaves and then send the leaf planes on their way.<br><br>

                The seeds may fly far enough to flourish in a part of the forest with less-dense vegetation.
                Someone might come along and see the message that's written on the tampered leaf plane.
                Other times, the leaf plane might fly unnoticed. Would you join them in making a leaf plane?<br><br>

                The idea behind this game was to share what I'm thinking about when I work on side projects.
                Part of me wants to have a bigger audience of people viewing my works.
                But whenever I work on one, I feel like I am making my own little leaf plane,
                and aimlessly flying it away. I’m not aiming my plane anywhere specific,
                it just exists and if it reaches somewhere, it reaches. Even though you might
                put a lot of effort into your craft, (and in the case of the game, more effort
                in your message or more effort into the throw), it doesn’t necessarily mean
                more people will see it. But I realized that was okay, because I don't want my motivation behind these projects
                to be contingent on the quantity of people who see them. I don't think I should put weight on
                things that are out of my control (I largely can’t control who can/can’t see my work or the quantity),
                but rather if I enjoyed the process of my project (in the context of the game, writing the message)
                that is what should matter to me. Although it is quite fun to talk about projects and ideas. ;D <br><br>

                Also, the character with the red cloak in the game is part of a bigger fictional story that I want
                to eventually write and possibly create a much bigger game about.
                Fun fact: The Memory Keeper's clothes were sewn by this character! <br><br>

                A mid-range PC build that has a soul! <br><br>
                The idea for this build was to create 3D print of some drawings I like to make (the last image on the carousel)!
                I ended up with a black-out PC build with white LEDs sourcing from the memory sticks and an external LED strip.
                When the PC is on, a white pulsing animation runs through the LED strip and towards the girl. There is a hollow
                section in the print so that end of the LED strip connects to her heart, making it appear like her heart is pulsing. :)<br><br>

                After building the PC, I booted up Blender and 3D modeled her (the first PC stress test!).
                I had to add some locking mechanisms to the head and arms so that I could add the dress.
                After modelling, I went to 3D print her from an on-campus service at my college, and I
                ended up meeting some cool people who were administering the printers. One time, I walked in on them
                3d printing bird-shaped whistles and saw them having fun making music.
                They also were lenient with printing multiple orientations and offering
                reprints. They asked curious questions about my print, and it made me excited seeing how interested they
                were in my little project! Good memories... Then I sewed the dress, locked the limbs into place, and
                added her to the tower! Fun fact: To create the eyes, I took a free sticker,
                scribbled black sharpie, and cut it into the right sizes. Problem solving: 100<br><br>

                A short story/character-focused game I'm working on with my brother, Caleb! <br><br>
                
                A young bat is recruited to work in a jewel-rich mine. The surface dwellers of the world
                find huge value in the pretty jewels sourcing from the mines, however they don't have any discerning
                physical nor practical qualities, other than looks. This makes the jewels hard to discover

                like the young bat. <br><br>
                
                In the mine, he meets 4 other coworkers--a senior, an energetic achiever, a carefree yet efficient friend,
                and another young recruit heaped with nervousness--all of whom have different
                perspectives on their current circumstances. Despite their differences, they all work their hardest
                day by day to meet their quotas. <br><br>

                One day, when the young bat is faced with a hard rock, he resorts to
                TNT to blow through the mine. Following the explosion, he finds a startling truth of their world...<br><br>
