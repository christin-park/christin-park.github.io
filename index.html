                "You want to know about me??<br><br>
                People call me a memory keeper, but you can call me Claud (it's pronounced like 'cloud')! <br><br>

                Heh heh... people always come to me to hear about others' memories, but my most favorite memories to share
                are my own. Here's one of my favorites: <br><br>

                When I was younger, I studied to be a historian of humans. But during my studies, I realized that
                the smaller memories and progress of people and their works were much more interesting than their
                bigger 'accomplishments'. That's why I changed over and became a memory keeper! <br><br>

                However, my time in schooling was not wasted. Once, I took a class
                to help me understand why humans create history in the way they do.
                Some people are motivated by self-fulfillment, others by external pressures, some by spirituality, and so on.
                But one perspective that stuck with me is best summarized by a quote by a human named Alan Watts: <br><br>

                'The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple.
                And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve
                something beyond themselves.' <br><br>
                
                I'm always scavenging for cool memories to keep. Whatever your motivation may be,
                don't forget to live life! It makes my job as a memory keeper more amusing." <br><br>

                I love food and cooking. :D <br><br>

                I've experimented with cooking from a lot of different cuisines, and I think my favorites now are South East Asian
                and Mediterranean dishes. But... I've still got a lot of foods to try!<br><br>

                My most favorite dish to share about is the calzone (the last image on the
                carousel). It was a cooking challenge--to create a dish using only ingredients mentioned in NieR:Replicant.
                I limited myself to beans, wheat, eggplant, tomato, chicken, mint and thyme (I mean... royal ferns), salt,
                berries, and mushrooms. I also made a cookie because it's Yonah's favorite food. :D <br><br>

                I love sharing a conversation and a meal with people, whether we cook or order from a restaurant. 
                If you ever want to grab food, just know that I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE CHOPSTICKS AHHHHHHH <br><br>

                But I'm totally down to getting food. :)

            <div class="click-text">
                The Earth Pass is an object in the Pixar movie "Soul". When a new soul finds their personality and spark in the
                Great Before (an existence before life on Earth), they unlock an Earth Pass, meaning they are ready
                to pursue a life on Earth. <br><br>

                "Soul" is one of my favorite movies which made me realize that
                life is not about just reaching a goal or because of a "spark", and reaching it does not ensure fulfillment.
                I learned that obsessing over one thing disallowed me to appreciate what just is. It is just as important
                to be enjoying life in the present, and to not overlook the little things in between! <br><br>

                Here is one of my favorite quotes from the movie, the retelling of a fish story: <br><br>

                “I heard this story about a fish, he swims up to an older fish and says: ‘I’m
                trying to find this thing they call the ocean.’ ‘The ocean?’ the older fish says,
                ‘That’s what you’re in right now.’ ‘This’, says the young fish, ‘this is water.
                What I want is the ocean!’”

                Among some of my other favorite movies/shows are Made in Abyss, WALL-E, Coco, and A Silent Voice
                (yes, I love cartoons). :)

                I don't draw as much now because of other priorities, but it is still something I want to

                I love listening to music! :D I like atmospherical songs and the sound of traditional instruments.
                A lot of my favorite songs come from shows or games, so they often accompany the visuals or mood without
                demanding the spotlight. I mostly listen to music during commute, so they feel like the soundtracks of life. :D <br><br>

                Here are some of my favorite songs:
                <ul>
                    <li>City Ruins from NieR: Automata: <a class="hyperlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMw-DUnR10s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMw-DUnR10s</a></li>
                    <li>Wretched Weaponry from NieR: Automata: <a class="hyperlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9c-t8hQCRo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9c-t8hQCRo</a></li>
                    <li>Prushka Sequence from Made in Abyss S2: <a class="hyperlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c09gHQ08CtI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c09gHQ08CtI</a></li>
                    <li>Tommorow from Made in Abyss S1: <a class="hyperlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Si0g20h_Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Si0g20h_Q</a></li>
                </ul>

                After listening to Devola playing Song of the Ancients in NieR:Replicant, I also got into playing the acoustic guitar. :)

                Here are some of the songs I enjoy playing:
                <ul>
                    <li>Aethervox from Drakengard 3: <a class="hyperlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgCvZ_gLpU0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgCvZ_gLpU0</a></li>

                There is a character-focused story that I want to write and maybe turn into a indie game in the future.
                I'll work on a website to explain my idea more (picture below). :) <br><br>

                Something I really love to do is to "give life" to characters. For example,
                when I played sandbox games when I was younger (specifically singleplayer Minecraft and Growtopia),
                I wrote a lot of storylines that had integrated game elements (parkour, puzzles).
                When I was more into art, I liked drawing/designing characters and thinking about the little details about them.
                I also had a lot of fun designing and writing the dialogue for the characters who live in this memory keeper hideout.
                And of course, I really loved making up little stories for my stuffed animals when I was a kid. :,) <br><br>

                It's a feeling that I don't want to completely abandon because of the fact that I have other priorities.
                I think I would have a lot of fun making an indie game with a small group of friends with this idea. 
                I really want to tell a meaningful story and to fully flesh-out the idea I have of the characters I'm thinking
                about. I do have other priorities in
                life right now, so I can't work on something with this scale by myself with the free time I have, but the world
                builds up in my mind when I daydream. :)<br><br>

                This quote by OMOCAT (creator of OMORI) sums up my thoughts towards games well: <br><br>

                "Games do everything that art is supposed to do and beyond.
                It mixes visuals, writing, music and sound, storytelling, and interaction
                and puts it all in one package… I want to get across the idea that game-making
                is an art medium, I am creating an art piece called OMORI and my
                medium is a video game." -OMOCAT <br><br>



                Fun fact: Claud's clothes were sewn by the character in a red cloak. :D
