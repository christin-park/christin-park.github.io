                My personal website displaying my intro, personal projects, and experiences! <br><br>

                Through this website, you can meet Claud, a memory keeper tasked to tell people my memories!
                I hope you enjoy meeting him and his friends. :)
                I designed this site so that if you are here for the content (viewing my work experience and personal projects),
                you can find it linearly and quickly. However, I also wanted to make it a place where I could share my interests,
                so I've added them in hidden places. If you want to see the other content on this website, try becoming more
                acquainted with the Memory Keeper ;). <br>

                <p class="project-header">Overview</p>
                An original technical project for IEEE TAMU! <br><br>
                
                Club members group up in teams to make either an Arduino breadboard or PCB game controller based
                on their current skill level. Workshops are held on breadboarding, Arduino, hardware implementation
                (joystick and push buttons), soldering, and PCB design. After teams finish their designs, they
                will compete by playing a competitive version of a custom-made game called Pixel Mouse for the fastest average time in
                3 maze levels for prizes. <br>

                <p class="project-header">Explanation</p>

                The Pixel Mouse game has 11 unique hotkeys, however only 4 (WASD/cardinal movement) are necessary to
                complete the game; all other hotkeys are coding challenges which give a better edge in completing a
                level quicker. <br><br>

                The game code has a function called 'private void Update() {}', which is a function that is repeatedly ran. It is useful for
                recieving real-time feedback from the player (this is similar to 'void loop() {}' in Arduino). The game is coded so
                that when a hotkey is registered, the action of that hotkey will play. For example, if you press 'J', the expected
                behavior would be to jump. However, on a keyboard, the button behavior is to spam the character when you hold a key down.
                Therefore the game had to be coded so that it only accounts for 1 'J' when you press a button down, instead of spamming
                the jump action everytime 'J' is registered per button press. <br><br>

                There are 2 versions of Pixel Mouse--a keyboard-compatible and Arduino-compatible version.
                The keyboard-compatible version shows the correct behavior of how Pixel Mouse should be ran, and the game's code
                accounts for the spamming behavior.
                The Arduino compatible version is essentially a bugged version of the way the game is meant to be played. The same 
                mechanism of 'if a hotkey is registered, the action of that hotkey will play' applies, however the game isn't coded 
                to account for the spamming behavior. Instead, it will be coded on the Arduino game controller.
                For the same example of 'J', you would want to code the button so that if you pressed the button, regardless of how
                long you hold it down, it will only register one 'J'. All hotkeys, button behavior, workshops, and general information are on the Pixel Mouse website
                linked below! <br><br>

                The PCB game controller is built with the HID-compatible ATMEGA32u4 to effectively work as a keyboard emulator. The design shown uses a USB connection
                for power and data transmission,
                a clock, a reset mechanism, and ICSP pins to program the microcontroller's bootloader to be compatible with the Arduino IDE. The digital
                pins are routed to the push buttons and the analog pins are routed to the analog joystick, and the Arduino code used for the breadboard 
                controller is used.

                A game where the player can write a letter on a leaf plane! <br><br>

                This game takes place in a world that has a special tree. The leaves on this tree
                grow in a way where they naturally crease at their stems. When they fall from the tree,
                the wind shapes the leaves into a plane-like form while carrying away the tree’s
                sticky seeds. Sometimes, the leaves don’t travel very far, so characters
                like to etch messages on these fallen leaves and then send the leaf planes on their way.
                Would you join them in making a leaf plane?

                (The character with the red cloak is part of a bigger fictional story that I want
                to write and maybe create a bigger game about.
                The Memory Keeper's clothes were sewn by the character with the red cloak :D!) <br>

                A mid-range PC build that has a soul! <br><br>
                The idea for this build was to create 3D print of some drawings I like to make (the last image on the carousel)!
                I ended up with a black-out PC build with white LEDs sourcing from the memory sticks and an external LED strip.
                When the PC is on, a white pulsing animation runs through the LED strip and towards the girl. There is a hollow
                section in the print so that end of the LED strip connects to her heart, making it appear like her heart is pulsing. :)<br><br>

                I made some really great memories from this project. One of my favorites was the time I went into a 3D printing service
                offered at my college and met the cool people administering the printers. They were really friendly and offered my print
                in multiple orientations/reprints and asked curious questions about my project.  Their interest made me really excited, and I felt
                encouraged to keep making personal projects! Also this one time, they were 3D printing bird-shaped whistles and were having fun making
                music with them. ;)

                A short story/character-focused game I'm working on with my brother, Caleb! <br><br>
                
                A young bat is recruited to work in a jewel-rich mine. The surface dwellers of the world
                find huge value in the pretty jewels sourcing from the mines, however they don't have any discerning
                physical nor practical qualities, other than looks. This makes the jewels hard to discover
                with instruments, and the task of hand-picking these jewels from mines are given to miners
                like the young bat. <br><br>
                
                In the mine, he meets 4 other coworkers--a senior, an energetic achiever, a carefree yet efficient friend,
                and another young recruit heaped with nervousness--all of whom have different
                perspectives on their current circumstances. Despite their differences, they all work their hardest
                day by day to meet their quotas. <br><br>

                One day, when the young bat is faced with a hard rock, he resorts to
                TNT to blow through the mine. Following the explosion, he finds a startling truth of their world...<br>
