                "You... want to know about me??<br><br>
                People call me a memory keeper, but you can call me Claud (it's pronounced like 'cloud')! <br><br>

                Heh heh... people always come to me to hear about others' memories, but my most favorite memories to share
                are my own. Here's one of my favorites: <br><br>

                When I was younger, I studied to be a historian of humans. But during my studies, I realized that
                the smaller memories and progress of people and their works were much more interesting than their
                bigger 'accomplishments'. That's why I changed over and became a memory keeper! <br><br>

                However, my time in schooling was not wasted. Once, I took a class
                to help me understand why humans create history in the way they do.
                Some people are motivated by self-fulfillment, others by external pressures.
                One motivation that stuck with me is best summarized by a quote by a human named Alan Watts: <br><br>

                'The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple.
                And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve
                something beyond themselves.' <br><br>
                
                I'm always scavenging for cool memories to keep. Whatever the motivation may be,
                don't forget to live life! It makes my job as a memory keeper more amusing." <br><br>

            <div class="found-text">You found puzzle pieces!</div> <br><br>
            <div class="click-text">
                These puzzle pieces represent my love for games. I love puzzles and story-focused games. :D
                I love games as a story-telling medium. It brings an element of immersion that passive
                story-telling mediums like books or movies can’t provide. I love when games change up the choices based on player input,
                or how 
                It’s my dream one day to be able to create a game, but… maybe if you find another hidden you can hear more about it. ;D <br><br>

                Some of my favorites (in no particular order, they’re uniquely great!): <br><br>

                NieR:Automata, where living without a purpose leads to existential dread. <br><br>

                OMORI, <br><br>

                Undertale, fills you with detemmienation.

                I love food and cooking. :D <br><br>

                I've experimented with cooking from a lot of different cuisines, and I think my favorites are South East Asian
                and Mediteranean. I've still got a lot of foods to try and dishes to master, but for now these are my
                comfort foods!<br><br>

                My most favorite dish to share about is the calzone (the last image on the
                carousel). It was a cooking challenge--to create a dish using only ingredients mentioned in NieR:Replicant.
                I limited myself to beans, wheat, eggplant, tomato, chicken, mint and thyme (I mean... royal ferns), salt,
                berries, and mushrooms. I also made a cookie because it's Yonah's favorite food. :D <br><br>

                I love sharing a conversation and a meal with people, whether we cook or order from a restaurant. 
                If you ever want to grab food, just know that I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE CHOPSTICKS AHHHHHHH <br><br>

                But I'm totally down to getting food. :)

            <div class="found-text">You found an Earth Pass!</div>  <br><br>
            <div class="click-text">
                The Earth Pass is an object in the Pixar movie "Soul". When a new soul finds their personality and spark in the
                Great Before (an existence before life on Earth), they unlock an Earth Pass, meaning they are ready
                to pursue a life on Earth. <br><br>

                "Soul" is one of my favorite movies which made me realize that
                life is not about just reaching a goal or because of a "spark", and reaching it does not ensure fulfillment.
                I learned that obsessing over one thing disallowed me to appreciate what just is. It is just as important
                to be enjoying life in the present, and to not overlook the little things in between! <br><br>

                Here is one of my favorite quotes from the movie, the retelling of a fish story: <br><br>

                “I heard this story about a fish, he swims up to an older fish and says: ‘I’m
                trying to find this thing they call the ocean.’ ‘The ocean?’ the older fish says,
                ‘That’s what you’re in right now.’ ‘This’, says the young fish, ‘this is water.
                What I want is the ocean!’”

                Among some of my other favorite movies/shows are Made in Abyss, WALL-E, Coco, and A Silent Voice
                (yes, I love cartoons). :)

                I don't draw as much now because of other priorities, but it is still something I want to
