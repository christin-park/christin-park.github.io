My personal website displaying my intro, personal projects, and experiences!
You can visit the website here: christin-park.github.io/website/

Through this website, you can meet Claud, a memory keeper tasked to tell people my memories! I hope you
enjoy meeting him and his friends. :)




Hey... you aren't on this repo to find all the website secrets are you? The memory keeper would be upset. ðŸ˜¢
