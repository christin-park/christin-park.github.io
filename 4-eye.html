                "Games do everything that art is supposed to do and beyond.
                It mixes visuals, writing, music and sound, storytelling, and interaction
                and puts it all in one packageâ€¦ I want to get across the idea that game-making
                is an art medium, I am creating an art piece called OMORI and my
                medium is a video game." -OMOCAT <br><br>

                Welcome to my world! This is a long-term future project that I dream to make
                into a story-focused indie game with a small group of friends. I want to tell a
                story that is character-focused and explores three characters' unique reactions
                to the dynamic, messy world around them. I have plans to make a website
                to better explain the world when I get the time. :)
