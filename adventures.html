                        A Las Vegas trip with Deeptha and Karthik :D. <br><br>
                        I'm so grateful for the opportunity to attend this conference. I met so many
                        people and it was incredibly inspiring to hear everyone's journeys.
                        It was also eye-opening to see so many workshops and talks centered on AI, and how
                        industries are changing to adapt it.
                        And a huge thank you for Bradley Schulz and the whole team for making the Project Showcase a reality this year,
                        where we were able to present Pixel Mouse (see projects page) and win 1st in the 
                        introductory projects category! <br><br>
                        
                        At the end of each day of the conference, we also got to explore the Vegas Strip. We tried
                        a bunch of good foods, including the best (and most expensive) pizza and kabocha squash I've ever eaten :,).
                        There were a lot of cool street performers sharing their craft of slap bass, music using trash, and singing.
                        And Karthik I will never <s>forgive</s> forget how you stopped to buy Fat Tuesday Daquiris after every hour of walking 
                        through the strip. :D
