                    "You want to know about me?<br><br>
                    People call me a memory keeper, but you can call me Claud (it's pronounced like 'cloud')! <br><br>

                    Heh heh... people always come to me to hear about others' memories, but my most favorite memories to share
                    are my own. Here's one of my favorites: <br><br>

                    When I was younger, I studied to be a historian of humans. But during my studies, I realized that
                    the smaller memories and progress of people and their works were much more interesting than their
                    bigger 'accomplishments'. That's why I changed over and became a memory keeper! <br><br>

                    However, my time in schooling was not wasted. Once, I took a class
                    to help me understand why humans create history in the way they do.
                    Some people are motivated by self-fulfillment, others by external pressures, some by spirituality, and well... the list goes on and on!
                    But one perspective that stuck with me is best summarized by a quote by a human named Alan Watts: <br><br>

                    'The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple.
                    And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve
                    something beyond themselves.' <br><br>
                    
                    I'm always scavenging for cool memories to keep. Whatever your motivation may be,
                    don't forget to live life! It makes my job as a memory keeper more amusing." <br><br>

                    I love playing PC games! <br><br>
                    I really love games as a storytelling medium. A quality that games have that other mediums don't
                    is the ability to interact with the world and its characters; I love when games change character dialogue or
                    game events based on the actions you take in-game. <br><br>
                    
                    Here are some of my favorites, and my main takeaways from their stories:
                    <ul>
                        <li>NieR:Automata, living without a purpose can lead to existential dread, but there are
                            ways to find hope in a tragic world.</li>
                        <li>NieR: Replicant, what's right is a matter of perspective, don't shortsight life by
                            blinding yourself to where others come from.
                        </li>
                        <li>OMORI, trauma does not pass on by suppressing it, part of the recovery
                            process is dealing with it face-on.
                        </li>
                        <li>Undertale, it... fills u with detemmination!!</li>
                    </ul>

                    I love food and cooking. :D <br><br>

                    I've experimented with cooking from a lot of different cuisines, and I think my favorites now are South East Asian
                    and Mediterranean dishes. But... I've still got a lot of foods to try!<br><br>

                    My most favorite dish to share about is the calzone (the last image on the
                    carousel). It was a cooking challenge--to create a dish using only ingredients mentioned in NieR:Replicant.
                    I limited myself to beans, wheat, eggplant, tomato, chicken, mint and thyme (I mean... royal ferns), salt,
                    berries, and mushrooms. I also made a cookie because it's Yonah's favorite food. :D <br><br>

                    I love sharing a conversation and a meal with people, whether we cook or order from a restaurant. 
                    If you ever want to grab food, just know that I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE CHOPSTICKS AHHHHHHH <br><br>

                    But I'm totally down to getting food. :)

                <div class="found-text">You found an Earth Pass!</div>  <br><br>
                <div class="click-text">
                    The Earth Pass is an object in the Pixar movie "Soul". When a new soul finds their personality and spark in the
                    Great Before (an existence before life on Earth), they unlock an Earth Pass, meaning they are ready
                    to pursue a life on Earth. <br><br>

                    "Soul" is one of my favorite movies which made me realize that
                    life is not about just reaching a goal or because of a "spark", and reaching it does not ensure fulfillment.
                    I learned that obsessing over one thing disallowed me to appreciate what just is. It is just as important
                    to be enjoying life in the present, and to not overlook the little things in between! <br><br>

                    Here is one of my favorite quotes from the movie, the retelling of a fish story: <br><br>

                    “I heard this story about a fish, he swims up to an older fish and says: ‘I’m
                    trying to find this thing they call the ocean.’ ‘The ocean?’ the older fish says,
                    ‘That’s what you’re in right now.’ ‘This’, says the young fish, ‘this is water.
                    What I want is the ocean!’”

                    Among some of my other favorite movies/shows are Made in Abyss, Hunter x Hunter, WALL-E, Coco, and A Silent Voice
                    (I love cartoons). :)

                    I love art! I usually draw digitally, and I've been getting into selling art (in the Art Business section
                    of the website!).
                    I am planning to draw some more stuff involving Demon Slayer,

                    I love listening to music! :D I like listening to music from a bunch of genres, but my favorites are atmospherical songs and traditional instruments.
                    A lot of my favorite songs are from shows or games. :D

                    There is a story that I want to write and maybe turn into a indie game in the future.
                    I have plans to work on a website to explain my idea more (picture below). :) <br><br>

                    I love to make fictional characters feel lively and animated.
                    When I played sandbox games when I was younger (specifically singleplayer Minecraft and Growtopia),
                    I wrote a lot of character-focused storylines with integrated game elements like parkour  puzzles.
                    When I drew more digital art, I liked drawing/designing characters and thinking about the little details about them.
                    I also had a lot of fun designing and writing the dialogue for the characters who live in this memory keeper hideout!
                    And of course, I really loved making up little stories for my stuffed animals when I was a kid. :,) <br><br>

                    I want to do something with this passion!
                    I think I would have a lot of fun making an indie game with a group of friends for this storyline. 
                    I can't work on something with this scale by myself with the free time I have, but the world
                    builds up in my mind when I daydream. When I find more time, I do want to spend it by at least getting the idea more
                    fleshed out in the form of comics or writing. :D<br><br>

                    I was really inspired by OMOCAT's (creator of OMORI) perspective of games and her whole journey of bringing
                    her story to life. Here's a quote from her: <br><br>

                    "Games do everything that art is supposed to do and beyond.
                    It mixes visuals, writing, music and sound, storytelling, and interaction
                    and puts it all in one package… I want to get across the idea that game-making
                    is an art medium, I am creating an art piece called OMORI and my
                    medium is a video game." -OMOCAT <br><br>

                    Fun fact: Claud's clothes were sewn by the character in a red cloak. :D

                    A game made by Team Robot Bird (Casey Pei, Christin Park, Dallas Coggins, Peter Schlenker) at Texas A&M's annual 48-hour game jam, Chillennium 2024!
                    Chillennium is the world's largest student-run collegiate game jam founded, staffed,
                    and organized by students at Texas A&M University. This year's theme
                    was "Hang in There!" Thanks to all staff members, industry specialist, volunteers, and Robot Bird
                    that helped us achieve 1st place in this year's game jam! <3 ;-; <br><br>

                    Follow the story of Ainex, a little robot searching around their inventor's workshop for a
                    way to help their friend. Use outlets, their charge and cords to swing your way around,
                    collecting lightbulbs and avoiding any spilled water.

                    Through this website, you can meet Claud, a memory keeper tasked to telling people about memories!
                    I hope you enjoy meeting him and his friends. :)
                    I wanted to design this site to allow linear and quick viewing of work experience, technical projects, and my art business.
                    However, I also wanted to make it a place where I could share my interests,

                    <p class="project-header">Overview</p>
                    An original technical project for IEEE TAMU, and an entry for the IEEE Rising Stars Conference 2024 project showcase! <br><br>
                    
                    Throughout the Fall 2023-Spring 2024 school semesters, IEEE TAMU club members grouped up in teams to make either an Arduino breadboard or PCB game controller based
                    on their current skill level. Workshops were held on breadboarding, Arduino, hardware implementation
                    (joystick and push buttons), soldering, and PCB design. After teams finish their designs, they
                    would have a functioning prototype that is programmed to play the custom-made game called Pixel Mouse. <br>
                    
                    A small overview of the Pixel Mouse project...<br><br>
                    The Pixel Mouse game has 11 unique hotkeys, however only 4 (WASD/cardinal movement) are necessary to
                    complete the game; all other hotkeys are coding challenges which give a better edge in completing a
                    level quicker. <br><br>
    
                    The game code has a function called 'private void Update() {}', which is a function that is repeatedly ran. It is useful for
                    recieving real-time feedback from the player (this is similar to 'void loop() {}' in Arduino). The game is coded so
                    that when a hotkey is registered, the action of that hotkey will play. For example, if you press 'J', the expected
                    behavior would be to jump. However, on a keyboard, the button behavior is to spam the character when you hold a key down.
                    Therefore the game had to be coded so that it only accounts for 1 'J' when you press a button down, instead of spamming
                    the jump action everytime 'J' is registered per button press. <br><br>
    
                    There are 2 versions of Pixel Mouse--a keyboard-compatible and Arduino-compatible version.
                    The keyboard-compatible version shows the correct behavior of how Pixel Mouse should be ran, and the game's code
                    accounts for the spamming behavior.
                    The Arduino compatible version is essentially a bugged version of the way the game is meant to be played. The same 
                    mechanism of 'if a hotkey is registered, the action of that hotkey will play' applies, however the game isn't coded 
                    to account for the spamming behavior. Instead, it will be coded on the Arduino game controller.
                    For the same example of 'J', you would want to code the button so that if you pressed the button, regardless of how
                    long you hold it down, it will only register one 'J'. All hotkeys, button behavior, workshops, and general information are on the Pixel Mouse website
                    linked below! <br><br>
    
                    The PCB game controller is built with the HID-compatible ATMEGA32u4 to effectively work as a keyboard emulator. The design shown uses a USB connection
                    for power and data transmission,
                    a clock, a reset mechanism, and ICSP pins to program the microcontroller's bootloader to be compatible with the Arduino IDE. The digital
                    pins are routed to the push buttons and the analog pins are routed to the analog joystick, and the Arduino code used for the breadboard 
                    controller is used.<br><br>

                    Deeptha Karur, Karthik Ravikumar, and I had the privilege of attending the Rising Stars Conference 2024 at the 
                    Tropicana Las Vegas Hotel in Las Vegas to represent Texas A&M.
                    A huge thank you for Bradley Schulz and the whole team for making the Project Showcase a reality this year,
                    where we were able to present Pixel Mouse and win 1st in the introductory projects category!

                    A game where the player can write a letter on a leaf plane! <br><br>
    
                    This game takes place in a world that has a special tree. The leaves on this tree
                    grow in a way where they naturally crease at their stems. When they fall from the tree,
                    the wind shapes the leaves into a plane-like form while carrying away the tree’s
                    sticky seeds. Sometimes, the leaves don’t travel very far, so characters
                    like to etch messages on these fallen leaves and then send the leaf planes on their way.
                    Would you join them in making a leaf plane?
    
                    (The character with the red cloak is part of a bigger fictional story that I want
                    to write and maybe create a bigger game about.
                    The Memory Keeper's clothes were sewn by the character with the red cloak :D!) <br>

                    A mid-range PC build that has a soul! <br><br>
                    The idea for this build was to create 3D print of some drawings I like to make (the last image on the carousel)!
                    I ended up with a black-out PC build with white LEDs sourcing from the memory sticks and an external LED strip.
                    When the PC is on, a white pulsing animation runs through the LED strip and towards the girl. There is a hollow
                    section in the print so that end of the LED strip connects to her heart, making it appear like her heart is pulsing. :)<br><br>

                    I made some really great memories from this project. One of my favorites was the time I went into a 3D printing service
                    offered at my college and met the cool people administering the printers. They were really friendly and offered my print
                    in multiple orientations/reprints and asked curious questions about my project.  Their interest made me really excited, and I felt
                    encouraged to keep making personal projects! Also this one time, they were 3D printing bird-shaped whistles and were having fun making
                    music with them. ;)

                    A short story/character-focused game I'm working on with my brother, Caleb! <br><br>
                    
                    A young bat is recruited to work in a jewel-rich mine. The surface dwellers of the world
                    find huge value in the pretty jewels sourcing from the mines, however they don't have any discerning
                    physical nor practical qualities, other than looks. This makes the jewels hard to discover
                    with instruments, and the task of hand-picking these jewels from mines are given to miners
                    like the young bat. <br><br>
                    
                    In the mine, he meets 4 other coworkers--a senior, an energetic achiever, a carefree yet efficient friend,
                    and another young recruit heaped with nervousness--all of whom have different
                    perspectives on their current circumstances. Despite their differences, they all work their hardest

                            A Las Vegas trip with Deeptha and Karthik :D. <br><br>
                            I'm so grateful for the opportunity to have attended this conference. I met so many
                            people and it was incredibly inspiring to hear everyone's journeys.
                            It was also eye-opening to see so many workshops and talks centered on AI, and how
                            industries are changing to adapt it.
                            And a huge thank you for Bradley Schulz and the whole team for making the Project Showcase a reality this year,
                            where we were able to present Pixel Mouse (see projects page) and win 1st in the 
                            introductory projects category! <br><br>
                            
                            At the end of each day of the conference, we also got to explore the Vegas Strip. We tried
                            a bunch of good foods, including the best (and most expensive) pizza and kabocha squash I've ever eaten :,).
                            There were a lot of cool street performers sharing their craft of slap bass, music using trash, and singing.
                            And Karthik I will never <s>forgive</s> forget how you stopped to buy Fat Tuesday Daquiris after every hour of walking 
                            through the strip. :D
